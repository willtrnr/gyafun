A little experiment with making a simple stack based virtual machine (kinda of
like the JVM) because I do whatever I want.

Since its implemented on Python it kind of inherits the dynamic typing features
as an unintended feature, kind of frees me from writing typed opcodes.

Right now there's only a pretty cheapo assembler available to craft bytecode,
but the idea is to eventually have a compiler (a basic one at least).

The goal is just to have something barely functional just for fun, there's no
real plan for this.
